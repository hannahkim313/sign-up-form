# Sign-up Form

## Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is an example of a sign-up
form for an imaginary coffee shop's rewards program. With a main emphasis on
both form and input elements, the final outcome reflects my understanding of
intermediate CSS concepts through a simple UI.

## In Action

### Form Demonstration

### Responsiveness Demonstration

## Goals

My ultimate goals for this project are to create a well-designed sign-up form
by implementing intermediate CSS concepts. I want to expand my CSS skills
by utilizing concepts such as advanced selectors, functions, and custom
properties to achieve a sign-up form that is both functional/responsive and
coherent in terms of design.
